                My name is Evelyn “Scrimshaw” Kealey Hodgson. <br>

                Born March 6th 2002 on stolen Anishinaabe and Algonquin land now called Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.<br>

                No credentials,<br>

                No schooling,<br>

                No job,<br>

                No therapist,<br>

                Zero manners,<br>

                Self made billionaire,<br>

            I am currently based in Tiohtià:ke (Montreal, Quebec), as an artist who is known to indulge in practices involving ‘artificial intelligence’ (ai). The following is my official statement on ai and how i’ve been using it (as of today, November 4th 2023. (1:54pm)). Written with the goal to transparently communicate my choices and practices with the technology to my audience, as well as to communicate why I am choosing to participate in the first place. Less an ethics statement, more a description of how I’m feeling, what I’m doing; and you guys get to decide if you think it’s ethical or not. Not here to convert anyone. <br>Do yo thang. This is me. <br> <br>

            <b>(Note: any images uncredited are my own work - you can see more <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kingscrimshaw/"> @kingscrimshaw</a> on instagram)</b> <br><br>

            As of today (November 4th 2023) ai is rightfully worrying many artists who (plan to) make a living off of their art. It seems like each day a new corner of the art market is being threatened and soon to be taken over by ai, spreading and dominating like some cancer. But hear me, fellow humans, when I say the ai is not the cancer: It is the <em>Suits</em>. <br><br>
            (<em>The Suits</em> are instruments of <em>The Man.</em> His underlings and bootlickers).<br><br>

            In a perfect world, the only role the Suits should have in the processes of contemporary art-centered media is to handle the business sides of things (such as broadcasting and marketing) while the artist does they thang. This is rarely the case. Today (talking specifically about big studios like Disney, Netflix, Warner Bros etc.) the Suits seem to hire an artist just to have something to broadcast in the first place; what is there doesn’t matter, as long as it will sell. Such a model exists to fill their pockets, and give the mob their bread and circuses. <br><br>

            Therefore, ai must seem like a wet dream to them. Not having to pay an artist in the first place? Have that hit TV show written in half the time? They’ll turn the writers room into a gym.<br><br>

            (We’re in the midst of the SAG-AFTRA strikes as I’m writing this; something I’m very very very happy to see. I would genuinely follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4SAPOX7R5M">Fran Drescher</a> into war. I won’t summarize the strikes as you can read up on the details yourselves, but it revolves around just this: ai in the hands of the Suits. Ai as a <em>replacement</em> for a human artist.)<br><br>

            This model of ai-application-in-the-arts is normally what comes to mind when discussing ai ethics in art. Or, artists’ lack of consent in their works being used in training data for ai developers. Add it to the list of the crimes of Big Data. <br><br>

            This essay will not be concerning these phenomena.<br>

            I cannot control the Suits.<br>

            I cannot control The Man.<br>

            I cannot control The Machine.<br>

            People have been trying for years, and I applaud them.<br>

            People try to yell so loud in hope that The Man might hear them, might listen.<br>

            I believe this to be futile. At least while we’re this small.<br>

            Even if he could hear you (he’s super duper tall) he doesn’t care.<br>

            He will cut costs wherever he can. He has for hundreds of years.<br><br>

            He will not stop unless he is forced to do so, and we need a lot more firepower & momentum before that happens (But I have faith in SAG-AFTRA’s efforts. They’re taller than you or I right now, they actually stand a chance). <br><br>

            Right now, all I can control is myself. And any who can hear me are my fellow humans on the ground floor. I will stand on a box in the town square and preach proudly that <em>The Man is not the only one with access to ai!</em> Thus, instead of breaching The Man’s tall castle walls, we must build a new castle. <br><br>

            Shoutout all my fellow artists with noggins full of ideas and not enough time on their hands. Shoutout all my fellow artists with noggins full of ideas and not enough money to carry them out. Shoutout all my fellow artists who fall in love with their own ideas only to HATE what comes into the material world via crude archaic methods such as “the human hand”.<br><br>

            Reject the meat body,<br>

            Transhumanism is the future (whether we like it or not).<br>

            The wave is coming.<br>

            The sands rumble and hum,<br>

            The water cup ripples like a damn T-Rex.<br>

            It’s in the tea leaves,<br>

            It’s in the tarot,<br>

            It’s on TV, idiot.<br>

            Chat GPT is already here.<br>

            And the wave will come tomorrow.<br>

            So no. I will not sit here and tweet about how the wave is evil.<br>

            I will not sit here and “X” about how I wish it wasn’t happening.<br>

            I will learn to surf.<br>

            I am young, and life is long. We must adapt now or be crushed.<br>

            <em>The Man is not the only one with access to ai!</em><br>

            It's not about the technology,<br>

            <b>It’s about how we use it.</b><br><br><br>
